Notes:
You will see a detail of various operators available in Perl in separate  \
chapter, but here we are going to list down few numeric and string operations
=cut

$str = "hello" . "world"; # Concatenates strings
$num = 5 + 10;            # adds two numbers.
$mul = 4 * 5;             # multiplies two number.
$mix = $str . $num;       # concatenates strings and number

print "str = $str\n";
print "num = $num\n";
print "mul = $mul\n";
print "mix = $mix\n";
