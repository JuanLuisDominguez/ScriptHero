Notes:
A scalar is a single unit of data. That data might  be an integer number,  \
floating point, a character, a string, a paragraph, or an entire web page. \
Simply saying it could be anything, but only a single thing.
Here is a simple exampÄºe of using sacalar variables
=cut

$age = 25;           # An integer assignment
$name = "Jonh Paul"; # A string
$salary =  1445.50;  # A floating point

print "Age = $age\n";
print "Name = $name\n";
print "Salary = $salary\n";
